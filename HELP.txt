Jakarta EE project example:

It contains Jakarta with REST, the start point is web.xml
Multi module project, containing resources:

The war is in the target directory of the application module.
It must be copied to the webapps directory of tomee server installation.

To start project:
- start tomee: rule catalina start in bin directory of tomee (we must have JAVA_HOME set)
- rule the end-points:
    http://localhost:8080/application-1.0-SNAPSHOT/api/...
To start projct in debug mode:
- copy the command:
set JPDA_OPTS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000"
in startup.bat in Tomee
- rule > catalina jpda start in cmd bin from Tomee
- in IntelliJ pun we must set a config Remote JVM Debug, we change only the port to be 8000
- Set a header of type Authorization in Postman with value Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==
- rule the end-points:
    http://localhost:8080/application-1.0-SNAPSHOT/api/...

For the treating of exceptions we have the module exceptions which contain classes Mapper for exception handlers.

The connection to the database is with postgresql, specified in module application in resources/META-INF/persistence.xml
and implemented with EntityManager in BookResource.xml.
The entity manager uses also a datasource at the moment of creation

For the connection to database to work, we have to create a resource
in the file conf\tomee.xml from tomee server:
<Resource id="MyDataSource" type="DataSource">
  	JdbcDriver = org.postgresql.Driver
  	JdbcUrl = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bookstore
  	UserName = postgres
  	Password = postgres
  	JtaManaged = true
  </Resource>
  This configuration disables the default hsqldb for tomee in data folder.

For the authentication and the authorization, there are implemented two filter:\
- LoginFilter which returns a token from the login end-point
- ResourceRoleBased which verifies the calculated token against the rest of the end-points
